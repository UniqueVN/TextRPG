TextRPG is an attempt to create a framework for RPG/adventure game using ASCII art in the console terminal. The final goal would be using this framework to prototype game story, dialogue and balancing the characters' attributes (mostly good for turn based game).

## Build
* Open TextRPG.sln with Visual Studio 2012 or later
* Select the solution configuration "Release" or "Debug"
* Select "Build > Build Solution" to build the .exe file
* There should be "TextRPG.exe" in folder "Release" (or "Debug" depend on which configuration you choose)

## Configuration
* Open file "Config.ini" in folder "Data"
* Change the variables's value as you want. The next time you run the program, it will use the new configurations
